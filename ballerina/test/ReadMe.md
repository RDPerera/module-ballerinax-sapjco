Due to the current unavailability of a dedicated SAP testing environment or a suitable SAP image, we were unable to
write test cases for this connector. This limitation has impacted our ability to perform full end-to-end
testing under realistic scenarios. We acknowledge this gap and recommend that users perform their own tests in a
controlled SAP environment to ensure the connector meets the specific needs of their applications. We aim to include a
suite of tests as soon as an appropriate testing environment becomes available.
